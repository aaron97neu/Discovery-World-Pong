# Currently this file is just the normal `docker-compose.yml`
# file with additional services which would be better done
# by just having the extra services and an extends keyword. However,
# the future plan is to replace the human paddle control mechanisms
# with a keyboard control to facilite testing without the depth
# camera, which would involve removing services.
