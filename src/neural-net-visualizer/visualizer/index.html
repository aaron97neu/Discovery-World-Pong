                The Pong "AI" makes decisions by using a type of machine 
                learning called Deep Reinforcement Learning. The graphic helps
                us understand how the AI is making decisions. Starting from the
                bottom, we see simplified picture of the pong game. This
                simplistic version of the game helps the computer focus on the
                important parts of the game (the paddles and the ball) and not
                get distracted by things like the background. Above this, we
                have the AI's "neurons". The number, weight (size), and
                connections between these neurons is what determines the AI's
                inteligence. The lines drawn between the pixels on the game and
                the "activated" neurons show which pixels are important to the
                network. The "importance" is determined by weights, which we
                determine when we "train" the algorithm. From there, each neuron
                can activate other neurons by using a similar mechanism. Neurons
                communicating with other neurons is what makes our AI
                <b>deep</b> reinforcement learning. From there, the activated
                neurons try to activate one of the three possible actions the AI
                can take. These are shown on top as "Left", "Right", and "None".
                The output with the most activation, shows as a percentage above
                the action, is what the opponent eventually does.
